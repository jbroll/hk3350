# HK3350 LIRC Configuration

This repository contains LIRC configuration files for the Harman/Kardon HK3350 receiver remote control. The configuration has been tested with a Raspberry Pi GPIO output directly wired to the HK3350's 3.5mm remote input jack. The hex codes were sourced from existing examples and verified to work with the actual hardware for controlling power, volume, input selection, and other receiver functions.
